MabelNet Falls Under The MCSPSL Licence. Please Read <a href="https://web.mabelisyt.co/mcspsl">The Licence</a> for more info.

## Note

MabelNet Is Being Phased Out In Favor Of MabelBBS, A Bulletin Board System That Will Have The Same Functions, But Remove The Need For A Server Client And Being On The Same Network As The Server. The MabelNet IP And Branding Will Be Reused Elsewhere.
